    <p>My name is Maria Paula Bernal Gonzalez, I am 21 years old and I was born in Bogota, Colombia. I lived in Bogota for almost 20 years before 2021 when my family and I moved to Pereira, a smaller city in the west of the country, where the coffee is a whole experience and the weather is unpredictable. I have had started my Graphic Design studies in 2019, but after my 4<sup>th</sup>semester I decided I wanted to change my pathway to technology and web design, there is when I decided to start an Interactive Design program; my parents offered me start from cero and I could choose to come to Canada and start here. </p>
    <p>I have been living in Canada for 5 months now, and I have already had the opportunity to know so many new places, overcome my fear of large lakes, and have lived in three different cities. I am currently in my first level of <abbr title="Intective Media Design">IMD</abbr>, I am living by my own for the first time and my dreams and plans are becoming real step by step.</p>
